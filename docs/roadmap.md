- Duplicate user warning on add
- Search and filters polish; mobile optimizations
- CSV export for per-user history

## v0.3 – Reliability & Audit
- Basic audit: who/when did actions (paired with light auth)
- Improved undo/soft-delete flows
- Error monitoring and logs surfacing

## v0.4 – Content & Catalog
- ✅ Bible API integration with auto-creation (ESV)
- ✅ On-demand verse fetching and storage

## v0.5 – Accounts & RLS
- Real auth for leaders (Supabase Auth, e.g., email links or Google)
- Enable RLS with leader policies

## Stretch / Future
- Quick-add multi-item entry flow
- Prize store UX (compose multiple items, subtotal preview)
- Multi-class/organizations with scoping
- Charts/visual dashboards
- Offline-capable PWA mode

## Backlog (prioritized)
1) Duplicate detection on user add (string similarity)
2) CSV export endpoints (server-generated)
3) Verse text cache and display
4) Admin secret rotation & management UX
5) Print styles for reports
6) Keyboard shortcuts for record flow
7) Class/org scoping (schema changes)
